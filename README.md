## About the challenge

This would be my first challenge from [frontendmentor.io](https://www.frontendmentor.io), this challenge can be a perfect example of how a basic webpage can be build i.e., can be as easy as possible with only HTML, CSS or as complex as possible with any of the frameworks etc.
